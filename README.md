# Prediction of Breast Cancer using Machine Learning approches.
Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database, we can create a classifier that can help diagnose patients and predict the likelihood of a breast cancer. A few machine learning techniques explored are: Logistic Regerssion, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor.
# Dataset information:
Dataset used is a  Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database, which information(attributes) digitized image of Fine Needle Aspirate(FNA) of breast mass which describes the characteristics of cell nuclei present in the image. Dataset is real multivariate dataset, contains 569 instances and 32 attributes.
Dataset Attributes:
1. ID number
2. Diagnosis
3. Radius
4. Texture
5. Perimeter 
6. Area
7. Smoothness
8. Compactness
9. Concavity
10. Concave points
11. Symmetry
12. Fractal dimension.
# Data exploration and Analysis of ML models
We visualise the data using density plots to get a sense of the data distribution. Also we visualise the correlation between variables using correlation matrix.
The ML models are trained and tested with K-fold cross validation. The results are found out without and with standardizing the dataset and compared using box-plots.
